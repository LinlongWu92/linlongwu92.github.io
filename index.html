I am currently a Research Scientist at SnT, University of Luxembourg, where I have been since Nov. 2020.
Prior to this, I worked as a Research Engineer at Alibaba Cloud from Nov. 2018 to Oct. 2020.
I received my Ph.D. in Electronic and Computer Engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in Nov. 2018, 
under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://www.danielppalomar.com/">Daniel P. Palomar</a>. 
Before that, I received my B.Eng. in Information Engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, China, in June 2014.<br />

<br />
My general research interest is in nonlinear optimization, signal processing and machine learning with applications in wireless sensing and communications.<br />
